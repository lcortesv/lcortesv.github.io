<h1 class= "about-text">
Coming from a background in which three cultures — Mixtec, Mexican, and American —have dominated my life, media on screen has been a meeting point for all three. With the determination to learn Spanish fast and easy, my parents turned to film and television. Together we turned to black and white Mexican films, and have since been fascinated with images and storytelling.
<br>
<br>My work is another language I’m still learning. I make promotional videos for Aggie Studios and aim to thread together a clear storyline through editing. With my work in graphic design, I make pieces inspired by the Mixtec or Mexico. Each work, though for promotional or for pure artistic purposes, comes with the idea that visual design can transcend the limits of spoken language.
